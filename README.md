# Suno Scripts
Browser scripts for working with Suno. This allows you to perform authenticated actions against the Suno API from your browser. **Note:** these scripts require you to execute them on suno.com, this is not a collection of scripts that act as a 3rd party API by design.

## PreReqs

1. First you'll need to open up the dev console.
2. Paste in code
3. Run your choosen script.

## Special Notes

Some scripts will have additional toggle options as comments within the script it self. Make sure you double check all that before running, or you might have a bad day.
